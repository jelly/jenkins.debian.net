# The hosts listed below are known to be down atm.
# No builds will be dispatched to those nodes, and the nodes will be marked
# as offline in the jenkins UI.
#
# The code greps for the local hostname, i.e.
# foobar-armhf-rb
# codethink-sled23-arm64
# profitbricks-build42-amd64
#
# (name coming from the basename of the workspace directory for start-agent.sh
# and from the list in reproducible_build_service.sh for reproducible_worker.sh)
#
# This means one could specify either the FQDN or the local hostname, bearing
# in mind the FQDN will always match, whereas the shorter variant may stop
# working.

# unstable in the past, the host is up but we are vaiting for vagrantc to confirm
# it is good enough to be enabled again.
