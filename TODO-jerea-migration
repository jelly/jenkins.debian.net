some ad-hoc notes which should be moved elsewhere or deleted
------------------------------------------------------------

* /var/lib/jenkins/init.groovy has been manually deployed
* plain http login should work by going to
  https://jenkins.debian.org/http-auth-jenkins/ but currently it doesn't.
  auth should be configured in /srv/jenkins.debian.org/etc/htdigest (NOTE:
  passwords here have NOTHING to do with the ones in jenkins itself).  Currently
  this is disabled by renaming the htdigest file
* jjb authenticate itself using an API token, which can be reset by going to
  https://jenkins.debian.org/user/jenkins-job-builder/configure and hitting
  "Change API token".  To get the API token run the following groovy script:
    import jenkins.security.*
    User u = User.get("jenkins-job-builder")
    ApiTokenProperty t = u.getProperty(ApiTokenProperty.class)
    def token = t.getApiTokenInsecure()
    println("token is $token")
* run the script via manage → script console; aka https://jenkins.debian.org/script
* jjb configuration is kept in /srv/jenkins.debian.org/etc/jjb.ini, so to run it:
    sudo -u jenkins-adm jenkins-jobs --conf ~jenkins/etc/jjb.ini …
